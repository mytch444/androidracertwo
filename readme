                Android Racer Two

------------------------------------------------------------

I have decided to make a second (much better) android racer,
my tron style game for android, it is currently in active
development with a focus on the gameplay (as in the menus are
bare minimum to test). Any advice on what to add and what
needs improving would be appreciated.

Updates

Now it really begins.
02.11.13: Never before have I had to use a do while loop. This
	  is a very radical time in my life. In other words, cleaning,
	  refractoring and fixing...
16.11.13: Added lives and blockades, made rendering lines much
	  more efficient (40% to 2% or something rediculous),
	  made explosions and linefall look better, more realistic.
	  Need to stop particles with blockades as they seem to
	  become more transparent than the blockade.
