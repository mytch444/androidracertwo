                Android Racer Two beta

------------------------------------------------------------

I have decided to make a second android racer, my tron style
game for android, it is still in the beta stage, exstreame
emphisis on beta, and I have only been working on it for 
about a week on it at this stage, my goals for this version
is that it will have game modes allowing players a bit of 
variety in the game. Any help would be appriciated (spelling
in particular as I am horribile at it and the glorious emacs
is lacking a spell check (but I could probebly get one if I
looked hard enough)). Any way, exspect ugliness and brutality
in all things graphical, I am trying to get it working at the
moment.

It is currently in a stage of chopping all the unnecisaries of
version one and cleaning up the code, making it more modular,
I have already added a new game mode and simple ways to add
more so it is underway.
